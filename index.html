    <p class="para">
      The <strong>Sun</strong> is the star at the center of our
      <em>Solar System</em> and is by far its most important object. It is a
      nearly perfect sphere of <mark>hot plasma</mark>, primarily composed of
      <strong>hydrogen</strong> (about 74%) and <strong>helium</strong> (about
      24%), with trace amounts of heavier elements. The Sun’s immense
      <em>gravity</em> holds the Solar System together, keeping
      <mark>planets, asteroids, comets</mark>, and other celestial bodies in
      orbit around it. The Sun has an approximate
      <strong>diameter of 1.39 million kilometers</strong>, which is about 109
      times that of Earth, making it the largest object in the Solar System. Its
      mass accounts for roughly 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.
      The Sun generates energy through the process of
      <em>nuclear fusion</em> occurring in its core, where hydrogen nuclei
      combine to form helium, releasing an enormous amount of energy in the form
      of <mark>light and heat</mark>. This energy is the primary source of
      illumination and warmth for Earth, making life possible. The structure of
      the Sun can be divided into several layers. The <strong>core</strong> is
      the central region where fusion occurs, reaching temperatures of around
      <mark>15 million degrees Celsius</mark>. Surrounding the core is the
      <em>radiative zone</em>, where energy slowly moves outward by radiation.
      Outside this is the <em>convective zone</em>, where energy is transported
      by convection currents. The Sun’s outermost visible layer, the
      <strong>photosphere</strong>, is the part we see from Earth and has a
      temperature of approximately 5,500 degrees Celsius. Above the photosphere
      lie the <em>chromosphere</em> and the <strong>corona</strong>, the latter
      extending millions of kilometers into space and visible during a
      <mark>total solar eclipse</mark>. The Sun is about 4.6 billion years old
      and is considered a middle-aged star. It is classified as a
      <strong>G-type main-sequence star (G2V)</strong>. Scientists estimate it
      has enough hydrogen fuel to continue shining for another 5 billion years
      before eventually evolving into a <em>red giant</em> and then a
      <em>white dwarf</em>. Solar activity, such as <strong>sunspots</strong>,
      <em>solar flares</em>, and <mark>coronal mass ejections</mark>, can
      influence space weather and have effects on Earth, such as disrupting
      satellite communications and causing <mark>auroras</mark>. The Sun’s
      consistent energy output drives the Earth’s climate, ocean currents, and
      weather systems, making it vital for all living organisms. In summary, the
      Sun is not only the central star of our Solar System but also the
      essential source of energy and life on Earth. Its
      <em>gravity, heat, and light</em> maintain the orbits of planets and
      sustain life, making it an <mark>irreplaceable celestial body</mark>.

      <strong>Mercury</strong> is the closest planet to the <mark>Sun</mark> and
      is the <em>smallest planet</em> in the Solar System. Despite its small
      size, it has a significant place in astronomy due to its unique
      characteristics and extreme conditions. <strong>Mercury</strong> is named
      after the Roman messenger god because of its swift movement across the
      sky. Its diameter is about <mark>4,880 kilometers</mark>, making it
      roughly <em>38% the size of Earth</em>, and it has a mass of only
      <mark>5.5% of Earth’s mass</mark>. One of Mercury’s most notable features
      is its proximity to the Sun, which causes <em>extreme temperatures</em> on
      its surface. During the day, temperatures can soar up to
      <mark>430°C (800°F)</mark>, while at night, they can plummet to
      <mark>-180°C (-290°F)</mark> because the planet has almost no atmosphere
      to retain heat. Mercury’s thin atmosphere, called an
      <strong>exosphere</strong>, is made of trace amounts of oxygen, sodium,
      hydrogen, helium, and potassium, but it is too thin to provide weather or
      significant protection from the Sun’s radiation. Mercury has a heavily
      cratered surface, similar to the Moon, with large impact basins and cliffs
      known as <em>lobate scarps</em>. The largest impact basin, the
      <mark>Caloris Basin</mark>, is about 1,550 kilometers in diameter. The
      planet’s surface also shows evidence of <em>volcanic activity</em> in the
      past. Mercury rotates very slowly, completing one rotation every
      <mark>59 Earth days</mark>, but it takes only
      <mark>88 Earth days</mark> to orbit the Sun, meaning a day on Mercury is
      longer than its year. Despite its small size, Mercury has a surprisingly
      large <strong>iron-rich core</strong>, which accounts for about
      <mark>75% of the planet’s radius</mark>. This dense core generates a weak
      magnetic field, about 1% as strong as Earth’s. Mercury has almost no moons
      or rings, and it orbits the Sun in a highly elliptical path. Because
      Mercury is so close to the Sun, it is difficult to observe from Earth,
      often appearing only near sunrise or sunset. Space missions like
      <strong>Mariner 10</strong> and <strong>MESSENGER</strong> have provided
      detailed information about its surface, composition, and magnetic field.
      In summary, Mercury is a
      <em
        >small, rocky planet with extreme temperatures, a cratered surface, and
        a massive iron core</em
      >. Its proximity to the Sun and unique rotation make it one of the most
      fascinating planets in the Solar System.

      <strong>Venus</strong> is the second planet from the <mark>Sun</mark> and
      is often called Earth’s <em>“sister planet”</em> because of its similar
      size and mass. Its diameter is about <mark>12,104 kilometers</mark>, just
      slightly smaller than Earth, and its mass is roughly
      <mark>81.5% of Earth’s mass</mark>. Despite these similarities,
      <strong>Venus</strong> is a very <em>hostile planet</em> with
      <mark>extreme temperatures</mark> and a dense atmosphere. One of the most
      notable features of Venus is its thick atmosphere, which is composed
      mainly of <mark>carbon dioxide (about 96%)</mark> and
      <mark>nitrogen (about 3.5%)</mark>, with clouds of <em>sulfuric acid</em>.
      This dense atmosphere creates a <em>runaway greenhouse effect</em>,
      trapping heat and making Venus the <strong>hottest planet</strong> in the
      Solar System, with surface temperatures around
      <mark>465°C (869°F)</mark> — hotter than Mercury, even though Mercury is
      closer to the Sun. <strong>Venus</strong> rotates very slowly and in the
      opposite direction to most planets, including Earth. It takes about
      <mark>243 Earth days</mark> to complete one rotation, which is longer than
      its orbital period of <mark>225 Earth days</mark>. This
      <em>retrograde rotation</em>
      means that the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east on Venus. The
      surface of Venus is rocky and covered with
      <em>volcanoes, mountains, and vast plains</em>. Volcanic activity has
      shaped much of the planet, and some volcanoes may still be active. The
      planet has <strong>no moons or rings</strong>. Due to its thick clouds,
      Venus is not easily visible in visible light, but it shines brightly in
      the sky due to sunlight reflecting off its clouds. Venus is often called
      the <em>“Morning Star”</em> or <em>“Evening Star”</em> because it is
      visible near sunrise or sunset. Space missions like
      <strong>Venera</strong>, <strong>Magellan</strong>, and
      <strong>Akatsuki</strong> have provided detailed information about Venus’s
      surface, atmosphere, and weather patterns. In summary,
      <strong>Venus</strong> is a
      <em>rocky planet similar in size to Earth but extremely hostile</em>, with
      <mark>scorching temperatures</mark>, a dense carbon dioxide atmosphere,
      and <em>slow retrograde rotation</em>. Its bright appearance and
      mysterious clouds make it one of the most fascinating planets in the Solar
      System.

      <mark>moderate temperatures</mark> suitable for life. The planet receives
      energy from the Sun, which drives <em>photosynthesis</em> in plants,
      powers weather systems, and provides warmth. The interaction of water,
      air, and sunlight creates a balanced environment where life can thrive.
      Humans have explored Earth extensively and have started observing it from
      space using <strong>satellites</strong> and <strong>telescopes</strong>,
      gaining a better understanding of
      <em>weather, climate, and natural resources</em>. Protecting Earth’s

      sunlight, making <strong>Saturn</strong> extremely bright and easily
      visible from Earth through a telescope. <strong>Saturn</strong> has a fast
      rotation, completing one rotation in about <mark>10.7 hours</mark>, which
      causes it to have a noticeable flattening at the poles. Its atmosphere
      exhibits bands of clouds and strong winds that can reach speeds of over
      <mark>1,800 kilometers per hour</mark>, producing storms and turbulence
      similar to, but less intense than, those on Jupiter. The planet has over
      <mark>80 known moons</mark>, with <strong>Titan</strong> being the largest
      and most well-known. <strong>Titan</strong> is larger than
      <mark>Mercury</mark> and has a dense atmosphere, making it unique among
      moons in the Solar System. Other notable moons include
      <strong>Enceladus</strong>, which has <em>geysers of water ice</em>, and
      <strong>Mimas</strong>, known for its large crater that gives it a
      resemblance to the <em>Death Star</em> from Star Wars.
      <strong>Saturn</strong> has been studied by telescopes and space missions
      such as <em>Pioneer 11, Voyager 1 and 2</em>, and
      <em>Cassini-Huygens</em>, which provided detailed information about its
      rings, moons, atmosphere, and magnetic field. In summary,
      <strong>Saturn</strong> is a magnificent <em>gas giant</em> known for its
      dazzling <strong>ring system</strong>, numerous moons, strong winds, and
      rapid rotation. Its beauty and unique characteristics make it one of the
      most fascinating and easily recognizable planets in the Solar System.

      <strong>Uranus</strong> is the seventh planet from the
      <mark>Sun</mark> and is classified as an <em>ice giant</em>, along with
      Neptune. It is unique in the Solar System due to its extreme axial tilt of
      about <mark>98 degrees</mark>, meaning it essentially rotates on its side.
      This unusual tilt causes extreme seasonal variations, with each pole
      experiencing <mark>42 years</mark> of continuous sunlight followed by
      <mark>42 years</mark> of darkness. <strong>Uranus</strong> has a diameter
      of about <mark>50,724 kilometers</mark>, making it nearly four times wider
      than Earth, and a mass roughly <mark>14.5 times</mark> that of Earth.
      <strong>Uranus</strong> is primarily composed of <mark>hydrogen</mark> and
      <mark>helium</mark>, but it also contains a significant amount of
      <em>“ices”</em> such as <mark>water</mark>, <mark>ammonia</mark>, and
      <mark>methane</mark>, which give the planet its
      <em>pale blue-green color</em>. The methane in its atmosphere absorbs red
      light and reflects blue-green light, creating its distinctive hue. The
      atmosphere also features faint <em>cloud bands</em>, storm systems, and
      occasional large storms similar to those on Jupiter and Saturn, although
      they are generally less visible. The planet rotates rapidly, completing
      one rotation in about <mark>17.2 hours</mark>, despite its extreme tilt.
      Its orbit around the <mark>Sun</mark> takes approximately
      <mark>84 Earth years</mark>, giving it very long seasons.
      <strong>Uranus</strong> has a relatively low internal heat compared to
      other giant planets, emitting less energy than it receives from the
      <mark>Sun</mark>, which makes its atmosphere cooler.
      <strong>Uranus</strong> has <mark>27 known moons</mark>, named mostly
      after characters from the works of <em>Shakespeare</em> and
      <em>Alexander Pope</em>. The five largest moons are
      <strong>Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon</strong>, each with
      unique geological features like <em>canyons, cliffs, and ice ridges</em>.
      <strong>Uranus</strong> also has a faint <em>ring system</em> composed of
      narrow, dark rings, which are less prominent than Saturn’s but were
      discovered in <mark>1977</mark>. The planet was discovered by
      <strong>William Herschel</strong> in <mark>1781</mark>, marking the first
      planet discovered with a telescope. <strong>Uranus</strong> has been
      studied primarily through telescopes from Earth and by the
      <em>Voyager 2</em> spacecraft, which passed close to the planet in
      <mark>1986</mark>, providing detailed images and data. In summary,
      <strong>Uranus</strong> is an <em>icy, pale blue-green giant</em> with a
      unique sideways rotation, faint rings, numerous moons, and extreme
      seasons. Its unusual tilt and distant location make it one of the most
      fascinating and mysterious planets in the Solar System.

      <strong>Neptune</strong> is the eighth and farthest planet from the
      <mark>Sun</mark> in our Solar System. It is classified as an
      <em>ice giant</em>, along with Uranus, and is known for its striking
      <em>deep blue color</em> caused by the presence of <mark>methane</mark> in
      its atmosphere. <strong>Neptune</strong> has a diameter of about
      <mark>49,244 kilometers</mark>, making it nearly four times the size of
      Earth, and a mass approximately <mark>17 times</mark> that of Earth.
      Despite its size, it is less massive than Uranus but denser.
      <strong>Neptune’s</strong> atmosphere is composed mainly of
      <mark>hydrogen, helium, and methane</mark>. The methane absorbs red light
      and reflects blue light, giving Neptune its vivid color. The planet is
      known for its extreme winds, which are the fastest in the Solar System,
      reaching speeds of up to <mark>2,100 kilometers per hour</mark>. Neptune
      also experiences large storms and dark spots, similar to Jupiter’s Great
      Red Spot, with some storms lasting several years. The planet rotates
      rapidly, completing one rotation in about <mark>16 hours</mark>, and takes
      approximately <mark>165 Earth years</mark> to complete one orbit around
      the <mark>Sun</mark>. Its long orbit means that each season lasts over
      <mark>40 years</mark>. <strong>Neptune</strong> emits more heat than it
      receives from the <mark>Sun</mark>, suggesting that it has an internal
      energy source, although the exact mechanism is still a subject of study.
      <strong>Neptune</strong> has <mark>14 known moons</mark>, the largest of
      which is <strong>Triton</strong>. Triton is unique because it orbits
      Neptune in a <em>retrograde direction</em>, indicating that it was likely
      a captured object from the Kuiper Belt. Triton is geologically active,
      with <em>geysers of nitrogen gas</em> observed by spacecraft. Neptune also
      has a faint <em>ring system</em> composed of several narrow rings, which
      are much darker and less prominent than Saturn’s.
      <strong>Neptune</strong> was discovered by
      <strong>Johann Galle</strong> in <mark>1846</mark> based on mathematical
      predictions rather than direct observation, making it the first planet
      located through calculations. The <em>Voyager 2</em> spacecraft provided
      the most detailed images and data when it flew past Neptune in
      <mark>1989</mark>. In summary, <strong>Neptune</strong> is a distant,
      <em>icy, and dynamic planet</em> with deep blue clouds, supersonic winds,
      faint rings, and intriguing moons. Its extreme conditions and unique
      features make it one of the most fascinating planets in the Solar System
      and the final planet in our planetary journey from the <mark>Sun</mark>.
